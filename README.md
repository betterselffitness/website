## Our Philosophy

**Simplicity is our feature.**

While other apps add more bells and whistles, we strip them away. We believe that if an app is too complex, you won't use it consistently.

- **Focus on Consistency:** Designed to be low-friction so you stick with it.
- **Privacy First:** Your health data is yours. Secure, private, and never sold.
